<h1 style=" font-size:45" ><u><center>ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION</h1></u></center>
<p style="font-size:18">Our Environment is an essential part of our life. It is the source for us to live and to do any of our actions such as eating, playing, working, enjoying, walking, breathing, hearing and drinking. The environment is our surroundings. </p>

<p style="font-size:18">The quality of our life depends on the quality and proper existence of our environment.   Environment includes the atmosphere, surrounding geographical area, natural resources etc.</p>

<p style="font-size:18">Long ago, people could live according to principles dictated by environment in a way that is harmless to the environment. In these days we are harming and degrading the environment and indirectly harming ourselves â€“ physically and biologically. So the ecological system or ecosystem is affected.  Its balance is affected and recycling phenomena of ecosystem are tampered.</p>  

<p style="font-size:18">Power of the technology and science has enabled the man to exploit the use of environment for selfish and indiscriminate use and create a problem for everyone.</p>
<p style="font-size:19"> The causes are: 
<ul type="circle" style="font-size:18">
  <li>   Deforestation 
<li>Depletion of water under surface of earth 
<li> Growth of population 
<li>Rapid urbanization 
<li>Extinction of some species, Loss of biodiversity 
<li> Air pollution (greenhouse gases), drinking water pollution,river pollution by mixing poisonous chemicals 
<li>Global warming 
<li> Depletion of ozone layer 
<li>  Depletion of oil and gas reserves and natural resources like minerals.
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18">We have to adapt to the environment. We have to follow regenerative and recycling mechanisms. We need to use resources in a discriminate manner. Otherwise, existence of humanity will become a question. People will suffer with a lot of diseases. Famines and cyclones will become more frequent. Rains will become very untimely and damaging instead of helping agriculture.</p><br>
